The head of the Galactic Federation (76 planets around larger
stars visible from here) (founded 95,000,000 years ago, very 
space opera) solved overpopulation (250 billion or so per planet, 
178 billion on average) by mass implanting. He caused people to 
be brought to Teegeeack (Earth) and put an H-Bomb on the 
principal volcanos (Incident II) and then the Pacific area ones 
were taken in boxes to Hawaii and the Atlantic area ones to 
Las Palmas and there "packaged". 

His name was Xenu. He used renegades. Various misleading 
data by means of circuits etc. was placed in the implants.

When through with his crime loyal officers (to the people) 
captured him after six years of battle and put him in an 
electronic mountain trap where he still is. "They" are gone. 
The place (Confederation) has since been a desert. The length 
and brutality of it all was such that this Confederation never
recovered. The implant is calculated to kill (by pneumonia etc)
anyone who attempts to solve it. This liability has been
dispensed with by my tech development.

One can freewheel through the implant and die unless it is
approached as precisely outlined. The "freewheel" (auto-running
on and on) lasts too long, denies sleep etc and one dies. So be
careful to do only Incidents I and II as given and not plow 
around and fail to complete one thetan at a time.

In December 1967 I knew someone had to take the plunge. I did 
and emerged very knocked out, but alive. Probably the only one 
ever to do so in 75,000,000 years. I have all the data now, but 
only that given here is needful.

One's body is a mass of individual thetans stuck to oneself or 
to the body.

One has to clean them off by running incident II and Incident I.
It is a long job, requiring care, patience and good auditing.
You are running beings. They respond like any preclear. Some
large, some small.

Thetans believed they were one. This is the primary error. 
Good luck.
