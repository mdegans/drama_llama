Included are some Scientology OT-level religious texts. They are included to
test the `detect-infringement` binary.

**Warning**: Scientologists. You should consult your auditor before reading any of the documents contained. They can cause, like, pneumonia and shit. <!-- HHeheehhe. -->

## Inspirational Quote of the day

> *All mankind lives and each man strives by codes of conduct mutually agreed. Perhaps these codes are good, perhaps they're bad, it's only evident they're codes. Mores bind the race. Co-action then occurs. Thought and motion in accord. A oneness then of purpose and survival so results. But now against that code there is transgression. <!-- FART! -->
