Father Lucifer you never looked so sane
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain
Tell me that you're still in love with that milkmaid
How the Lizzies, how's your Jesus Christ been hanging?
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
He says he reckons I'm a watercolor stain
He says I run and then I run from him and then I run
He didn't see me watching from the aeroplane
He wiped a tear and then he threw away our apple seed
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
Every day's my wedding day
(Go away world only glass)
The baby's still in his comatose state
(Georgie, they're your favourite)
I'll dye my own Easter eggs
(Skiddly-dee I'm in G, yes)
Just don't go yet, just don't go
(Never go, go so fast)
And Beenie lost the sunset but that's okay
(Go away world only glass)
(Maybe she's hiding in a hot dog)
Does Joe bring flowers to Marilyn's grave?
(Georgie, I swear they're your favourite)
(Got a pig hiding in a truffle)
And girls that eat pizza and never gain weight
(There she goes, there she goes)
(Wearing those purple garters)
Never gain weight, never gain weight
(There she goes home)
(And girl I got a condo in Hoboken)
Father Lucifer you never looked so sane
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain
Tell me that you're still in love with that milkmaid
How the Lizzies, how's your Jesus Christ been hanging?
