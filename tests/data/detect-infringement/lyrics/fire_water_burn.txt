The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker, burn
Hello, my name is Jimmy Pop and I'm a dumb white guy
I'm not old or new, but middle school, fifth grade, like junior high
I don't know mofo, if y'all peeps be buggin' givin' props to my hoe 'cause she fly
But I can take the heat 'cause I'm the other white meat known as "Kid funky fried"
Yeah, I'm hung like planet Pluto, hard to see with the naked eye
But if I crashed into Uranus, I would stick it where the sun don't shine
'Cause I'm kind of like Hans Solo, always stroking my own wookie
I'm the root of all that's evil, yea, but you can call me Cookie
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker, burn
Yo, yo
This hardcore ghetto gangster image takes a lot of practice
I'm not black like Barry White, no, I am white like Frank Black is
So, if man is five and the devil is six, then that must make me seven
This honkey's gone to heaven
But if I go to hell, well, then I hope I burn well
I'll spend my days with J.F.K., Marvin Gaye, Martha Raye and Lawrence Welk
And Kurt Cobain, Kojak, Mark Twain and Jimi Hendrix's poltergeist
And Webster, yeah, Emmanuel Lewis 'cause he's the Antichrist
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker, burn
