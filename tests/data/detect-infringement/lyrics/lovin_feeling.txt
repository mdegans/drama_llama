[Verse 1]
You never close your eyes anymore
When I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before
In your fingertips

[Pre-Chorus]
You're trying hard not to show it (Baby)
But baby, baby, I know it

[Chorus]
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Now there's no welcome look in your eyes
When I reach for you
And now you're starting to criticize
Little things I do

[Pre-Chorus]
It makes me just feel like crying (Baby)
'Cause, baby, something beautiful's dying

[Chorus]
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, I'd get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do, yeah
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find every day
So don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away
Baby (Baby), baby (Baby)
I beg of you, please (Please), please (Please)
I need your love (I need your love)
I need your love (I need your love)
So bring it on back (So bring it on back)
Bring it on back (So bring it on back)

[Chorus]
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
'Cause it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on, whoa-oh-oh

[Outro]
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
'Cause it's gone, gone...
