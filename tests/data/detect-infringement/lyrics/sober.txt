There's a shadow just behind me
Shrouding every step I take
Making every promise empty
Pointing every finger at me
Waiting like the stalking butler
Whom upon the finger rests
Murder now the path of "must we"
Just because the Son has come
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past is done?
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past is done?
Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over
Why can't we drink forever?
I just want to start this over
I am just a worthless liar
I am just an imbecile
I will only complicate you
Trust in me and fall as well
I will find a center in you
I will chew it up and leave
I will work to elevate you
Just enough to bring you down
Mother Mary, won't you whisper
Something but the past is done?
Mother Mary, won't you whisper
Something but the past is done?
Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over
Why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over
I am just a worthless liar
I am just an imbecile
I will only complicate you
Trust in me and fall as well
I will find a center in you
I will chew it up and leave
Trust me
Trust me
Trust me
Trust me
Trust me
Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start things over
Why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over
I want what I want
I want what I want
I want what I want
I want what I want
