Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because
My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time
Oh, baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because
My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time
Oh, baby, baby
Oh-oh
Oh, baby, baby
Eh-eh-yeah
Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here, and give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time
I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here, and give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
