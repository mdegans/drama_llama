# RIIR moeflux: strategy

Captured 2026-04-27. Decision: rewrite moeflux's host-side dispatch
in Rust. Triggered by bisect findings (see
`blallama_session_state_pollution.md`) — the bugs found are exactly
the kind that disappear in a Rust rewrite (process-globals with raw
pointers; semantic invariants the C API silently violates).

## Scope

In:
- `metal_infer/infer.m` (8002 lines of host-side Objective-C
  dispatch) → idiomatic Rust.
- `metal_infer/model_variant.h` → `mod variants` enum.
- `metal_infer/tokenizer.{h,bin}` → `mod tokenizer`.
- `crates/moeflux-sys/` → deleted at cutover.

Out (stays as-is):
- `metal_infer/shaders.metal` (1385 lines) — Metal kernels keep
  their license attribution (Mike wrote them) and don't get
  rewritten.
- Python conversion scripts (`extract_weights.py`,
  `repack_experts.py`, `export_*.py`) — Python is the right tool
  for the model-prep pipeline.
- `metal_infer/main.m` (1847 lines, CLI driver) — drama_llama is
  the only consumer; no need.

## Ground rules

- **No `Arc`.** Single `&mut Ctx` for inference. Deferred-experts
  state is a field on `Ctx`, not a global. Metal command buffers
  RAII'd within method scopes.
- **`metal-rs`** for Metal bindings (mature; used by candle,
  mistral.rs).
- **Compile-time variant selection** kept 1:1 during the port (the
  existing `MOEFLUX_MODEL_*` Cargo features) so differential tests
  are apples-to-apples. Runtime-variant rearchitecture is post-port.
- **Don't translate bugs.** Where C has a clear bug, fix in place
  during the port. Where unsure, leave a `// FIXME(riir):` with the
  original `infer.m:LINE` reference.
- **No new build systems.** `cargo build`, `cargo test`. Shader
  compile goes through `build.rs` or runtime `MTLLibrary::with_source`.

## Branch & cutover

- Work in `~/Projects/moeflux` on a `riir` branch off main.
- Single squashed cutover commit at Phase 6.
- drama_llama keeps using `moeflux::*` throughout — no churn there
  until cutover.

## Phases

| # | Phase | Approx |
|---|-------|--------|
| 0 | Differential harness (`tests/diff/`, `DiffBackend` trait, comparison helpers; Rust side panics until Phase 1) | 1–2h |
| 1 | Pure-Rust foundations: `mod variants`, `mod weight_file`, `mod vocab`, `mod tokenizer`, `mod quant` | 4–8h |
| 2 | Metal infrastructure: `metal-rs` device/queue/library/pipeline cache, RAII buffers | 4–8h |
| 3 | Forward pass bottom-up: embedding, RMSNorm, RoPE, full attn, linear attn, MoE router, MoE dispatch, LM head — diff-tested per kernel | 8–16h |
| 4 | Top-level: `eval_prompt`, `eval_token`, `memory_*`, `state_save`/`load` | 4–8h |
| 5 | API stabilization, drama_llama full test run | 2–4h |
| 6 | Cutover: delete C, move shaders, squash | 1–2h |
| 7 | Post-cutover (separate PRs): typed `memory_seq_rm`, multi-Ctx, runtime variant dispatch, expanded coverage | 4–8h |

Total: 28–48h focused work.

## Differential harness shape

`crates/moeflux/tests/diff_oracle.rs` exposes a `DiffBackend` trait
that both the existing C path (via `moeflux-sys`) and the new Rust
path implement.

**Originally planned**: end-to-end logits comparison with argmax
match + top-K Jaccard ≥ 0.95 + cosine ≥ 0.99.

**Refined (Phase 0 finding)**: end-to-end logits are NOT a useful
oracle. The C path itself is non-deterministic across
`memory_clear` for the same prompt (cosine ≈ 0.65–0.76 between
two C-side runs), so we can't expect Rust-vs-C to be tighter than
that. The original bisect's `memory_clear_*` tests were green only
because they used argmax + trajectory equality, which both pass
trivially when greedy decoding lands in the same attractor (a
runaway 5073 token in our synthetic-prompt case).

**Real diff strategy (Phase 3+)**: intermediate-tensor checkpoints.
Both backends expose hooks that dump per-layer outputs (post-RMSNorm,
post-attention, post-MoE, etc.). Compare layer-by-layer where Metal
nondeterminism has had less chance to accumulate. The earliest
divergence between C and Rust pinpoints the exact kernel that's
been mis-ported.

The Phase 0 harness in place today has the trait + impls + helpers
+ a scaffold-validation test (`harness_loads`). The intermediate-
checkpoint hooks come in Phase 3 when there's actually something to
compare.

## What the bisect tests become

- `consecutive_eval_prompt.rs` (in moeflux): keep as-is during
  port. Two of its four sub-tests fail today; they're expected to
  pass after Phase 7's typed `memory_seq_rm` and multi-Ctx work.
- `moeflux_session_pollution.rs` (in drama_llama): currently
  passes; serves as a regression guard the Rust port must keep
  passing throughout.

## Why this fixes the bisect findings

- **Cross-Ctx NaN bug**: `g_deferred` is a file-scope global with a
  raw pointer that outlives its referent. In Rust, that becomes a
  field on `Ctx` (or part of an MoE dispatcher owned by the Ctx).
  Lifetime-checked. The class of bug doesn't compile.
- **Partial-truncate divergence**: in Rust, `memory_seq_rm` returns
  `Result<(), CannotTruncateLinear>`. Callers must explicitly
  handle the case where linear-attn state can't be unwound — the
  silent-lossy behavior of the C API becomes a typed error.
